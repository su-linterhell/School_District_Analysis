# School_District_Analysis
Analyzing testing scores for schools within a district to uncover trends. 

## Overview of the school district analysis
Working with the data scientists for school district, this analysis dives into the standardized test schools and allocated school budgets to showcase trends in school performance. These trends will help the superintendent make informed decisions around school budget allotments. 

Working through different key metrics, it came to our attetion that there may be some academic dishonesty at one of the schools. In order to help improve the accuracy of this analysis, part of the school data for Thomas High School has been replaced with NaN. Only 9th grade math & reading scores were changed to NaN in order to increase data accuracy. 

## Results
In our original analysis these are the key metrics that were measured:
  * The district summary
  * The school summary
  * The top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
  * The average math score for each grade level from each school
  * The average reading score for each grade level from each school
  * The scores by school spending per student, by school size, and by school type


There is a bulleted list that addresses how each of the seven school district metrics was affected by the changes in the data (10 pt).
Summary:

There is a statement summarizing four major changes to the school district analysis after reading and math scores have been replaced (5 pt).
